\title{Overview of Unmarked:\\
An R Package for the Analysis of Wildlife Data}
\author{Ian Fiske and Richard Chandler}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\abstract{Unmarked aims to be a complete environment for the
  statistical analysis of wildlife data. Currently, the focus is on
  2-level hierarchical models that separately model a latent state and
  an observation process. Unmarked uses S4 classes to help the user
  both explore their data and analyze in a transparent manner.}


\section{Overview of unmarked}

Occupancy and abundance data are often associated with metadata related to the design of the study. For example, in distance sampling, the study design (line- or point-transect), distance class break points, transect lengths, and units of measurement need to be accounted for in the analysis. Unmarked uses S4 classes to store data and metadata in a way that allows for easy data manipulation, summarization, and model specification. Table 1 lists the currently implemented models and their associated fitting functions and data classes.

Each data class can be created with a call to the constructor function
of the same name as described in the examples below.


\section{Typical unmarked session}

The first step is to import the data into R.  This can be accomplished
with either a call to the appropriate type of unmarkedFrame:

<<>>=
library(unmarked)
wt <- read.csv(system.file("csv","widewt.csv", package="unmarked"))
head(wt)
y <- wt[,2:4]
siteCovs <-  wt[,c("elev", "forest", "length")]
obsCovs <- reshape(wt[,c("date.1", "date.2", "date.3",  "ivel.1",  "ivel.2", "ivel.3")], varying=1:6, direction="long")
obsCovs <- obsCovs[order(obsCovs$id, obsCovs$time),c(2:3)]
wt <- unmarkedFrameOccu(y = y, siteCovs = siteCovs, obsCovs = obsCovs)
summary(wt)
@

or by using the convenience function \verb=csvToUMF=:

<<>>=
wt <- csvToUMF(system.file("csv","widewt.csv", package="unmarked"), long = FALSE, type = "unmarkedFrameOccu")
@

If not all sites have the same numbers of observations, then manual
importation of data in long format can be tricky.  \verb=csvToUMF=
seemlessly handles this situation.

<<>>=
pcru <- csvToUMF(system.file("csv","frog2001pcru.csv", package="unmarked"), long = TRUE, type = "unmarkedFrameOccu")
summary(pcru)
@

To help stabilize the numerical optimization algorithm, we recommend
standardizing the covariates.

<<>>=
	obsCovs(pcru) <- scale(obsCovs(pcru))
@


Occupancy models can then be fit with the occu() function:

<<fig=TRUE>>=
	fm1 <- occu(~1 ~1, pcru)
	fm2 <- occu(~ MinAfterSunset + Temperature ~ 1, pcru)
	summary(fm1)
	summary(fm2)
	plot(fm2)
@

Here, we have specified that the detection process is modeled with the
MinAfterSunset and Temperature covariates.  No covariates are
specified for occupancy here.  See ?occu for more details.
			
Unmarked fitting functions return unmarkedFit objects which can be
queried to investigate the model fit.  Variables can be
back-transformed to the unconstrained scale using backTransform.
Standard errors are computed using the delta method.

<<>>=
backTransform(fm2, 'state')
@

Because the detection component was modeled with covariates, covariate
coefficients must be specified to back-transform.  Here, we request
the probability of detection given a site is occupied and all
covariates are set to 0.

<<>>=
backTransform(linearComb(fm2, coefficients = c(1,0,0), type = 'det'))
@

A predict method also exists.

<<>>=
newData <- data.frame(MinAfterSunset = 0, Temperature = -2:2)
head(predict(fm2, type = 'det', newdata = newData, appendData = TRUE))
@


Confidence intervals are requested with confint, using either the
asymptotic normal approximation or profiling.


<<>>=
confint(fm2, type='det')
confint(fm2, type='det', method = "profile")
@

Model selection and multi-model inference can be implemented after
organinzing models using the fitList function.

<<>>=
fms <- fitList(Null = fm1, TimeTemp = fm2)
modSel(fms, nullmod=fm1)
head(predict(fms, type='det', newdata = newData, appendData = TRUE))
@


Parametric bootstrapping can be used to check the adequacy of model fit.

<<fig=TRUE>>=
	pcru.pb <- parboot(fm2, nsim=50, report=5)
	plot(pcru.pb)
@

This example suggests an adequate fit.
