\title{Models for Data from Unmarked Animals}
\description{\emph{unmarked} fits hierarchical models of occurrence and abundance to data collected on species subject to imperfect detection.  Examples include single- and multi-season site occupancy models, binomial mixture models, and multinomial mixture models. The data can arise from survey methods such occurrence sampling, temporally replicated counts, removal sampling, double-observer sampling, and distance sampling. Parameters governing the state and observation processes can be modeled as functions of covariates. General 
treatment of these models can be found in MacKenzie et al. (2006) and 
Royle and Dorazio (2008).}

\strong{Overview of Model-fitting Functions:}  

\code{\link{occu}} fits occurrence models with no linkage between abundance and 
detection (MacKenzie et al. 2002).  

\code{\link{occuRN}} fits abundance models to presence/absence data by 
exploiting the link between detection probability and abundance (Royle and 
Nichols 2003).

\code{\link{colext}} fits the mutli-season occupancy model of 
MacKenzie et al. (2003).

\code{\link{pcount}} fits N-mixture models (aka binomial mixture models) to 
repeated count data (Royle 2004a, Kéry et al 2005).  

\code{\link{distsamp}} fits the distance sampling model of 
Royle et al. (2004) to distance data recorded in discrete intervals. 

\code{\link{multinomPois}} fits the multinomial-Poisson model of Royle (2004b) 
to data collected using methods such as removal sampling or double observer 
sampling.

\code{\link{gmultmix}} fits a generalized form of the multinomial-mixture model 
of Royle (2004b) that allows for estimating availability and detection 
probability.  

\strong{Data:} All data are passed to unmarked's estimation 
functions as a formal S4 class called an unmarkedFrame, which has child classes 
for each model type. This allows metadata (eg as distance interval cut points, 
measurement units, etc...) to be stored with the response and covariate data.
See \code{\link{unmarkedFrame}} for a detailed description of unmarkedFrames
and how to create them.

\strong{Model Specification:}  \emph{unmarked}'s
model-fitting functions allow specification of covariates for both the
state process and the detection process.  For two-level hierarchical models, 
(eg \code{\link{occu}}, \code{\link{occuRN}}, \code{\link{pcount}}, 
\code{\link{multinomPois}}, \code{\link{distsamp}}) covariates for the 
detection process (at the site or observation level) and the state process (at 
the site level) are specified with a double right-hand sided formula, in that 
order.  Such a formula looks like
 
\eqn{~ x1 + x2 + \ldots + x_n  ~ x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n} 

where \eqn{x_1}{x1} through \eqn{x_n}{xn} are additive covariates of
the process of interest.  Using two tildas in a single formula 
differs from standard R convention, but it is informative about the model 
being fit. The meaning of these covariates, or what they
model, is full described in the help files for the individual functions
and is not the same for all functions. For models with more than two processes
(eg \code{\link{colext}}, \code{\link{gmultmix}}), single right-hand sided 
formulas (only one tilda) are used to model each parameter.

\strong{Utility Functions:}  \emph{unmarked} contains several utility
functions for organizing data into the form required by its model-fitting
functions.  \code{\link{csvToUMF}} converts an appropriately
formated comma-separated values (.csv) file to a list containing the
components required by model-fitting functions.}
